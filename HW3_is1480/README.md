# HW3 - Ian Stuart

#### This assignment was done almost entirely on my own by necessity since I was not feeling well over the weekend and needed to work from home. I did discuss some of the logistics of the assignment with Jordan Vani.

### Assignment 1

This was an exercise in which the effects of the Central Limit Theorem could be seen by taking samples in a similar fashion from each of 5 different distributions. Each distribution affected the resulting distribution of sample means a little bit, but the results were all similar and showed the CLT in action.

### Assignment 2

This assignment required the identification of a categorical variable from CitiBike data that could be used in formulate a hypothesis that can be tested using the data. I chose to look at possible differences in weekend/weekday riding patterns for short-term versus annual members. Cleaning and normalizing the data was required in order to set it up for analysis.

### Assignment 3

Here we looked at the use of the z-score to identify how different a result is than what we might expect, given a specified p-value. In this case, the result was the average length of bus commute times compared with the historical average. With a z-score greater than 2, we would expect to get a similar result no more than 5% of the time if there were indeed no changes in average commute times.
