# HW 5

## Assignment 1

The challenge for this assignment was not technical but theoretical, in terms of how to manipulate the data for use in 
the different goodness-of-fit tests, and how to interpret the results of those tests. I had conversations with Jonathan
Pichot, Felipe Gonzalez, and Shay Lehmann about these questions. 

## Assignment 2

I needed to spend some time studying a few regression examples to wrap my head around how the problems were being constructed with Python, e.g. using the appropriate variable types, inputting vectors into regression functions, etc. I spoke with Chris Streich (who had worked with others) to get some insight on why my regression line was different than the analytical solution offered by @fedhere.

## Assignment 3

This assignment was completed on my own.
