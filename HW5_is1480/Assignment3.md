### For all hypotheses, we would include the chosen level of significance.

#### Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

* H0: People who diet rather than exercise lose the same or less weight, on average, than those who exercise instead of diet.

* H0: weight loss (deiters) <= weight loss (exercisers)

#### Do American trust the president?
POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: 
“From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). 
Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

* H0: The number of Americans who do not think Bill Clinton has the honesty and integrity they expect in a president is greater 
than or equal to the number that think he does.

* H0: number of people who don't trust Clinton >= number of people who trust Clinton 

#### Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

* H0: Cessation rates for people using nicotine patches are the same or lower than rates for people using a placebo patch.

* H0: cessation rate (nicotine patch) <= cessation rate (placebo patch)

#### Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

* H0: The IQ of young children of whose mothers smoked during pregnancy is the same or higher, on average, than the IQ of children whose mothers did not smoke.

* H0: child IQ (mother smoked) >= child IQ (mother did not smoke)
