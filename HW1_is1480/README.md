## Setting up environment variables

To set up environment variables to allow easier access to the PUI directory on compute, I edited the .bashrc file located in the /home/cusp/is1480 directory. These lines were added to the file:
```
export PUI2016=/home/cusp/is1480/PUI2016_is1480/
alias pui2016='cd $PUI2016'
```
Images of the .bashrc file and the new variables in use are below:

![variables in use](variables_inuse.png)

## Wrapping up

A new repo titled PUI2016_is1480 was created on github and initialized in a directory of the same name on my local machine, which was then linked to the remote repo using 'git remote add origin <url>'. 

All work in the introductory lab and homework assignment was completely my own. I did not work with anyone else, aside from the required fork and pull request.
