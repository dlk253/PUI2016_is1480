#HW4 - Ian Stuart

## Assignment 1

Please see comments in Alan-F's HW3 repository.

## Assignment 2

For this exercise I worked with Jordan Vani to identify two papers we could review. We were able to find a simple t-Test example fairly quickly, but finding a multiple regression example that we could follow was a little more difficult. Many of the papers we initially looked at turned out to be various other types of regression analyses, but not traditional multiple regressions. 

We finally found the study on commercial sex workers and HIV prevalence rates. The tackle the question several different ways, one of which is multiple regression. The effect of the rate of HIV in commercial sex workers on the HIV rate in the general population is what they are after, but they include several other variables in the study. They refer to the inclusion of this variables as way to 'control' for them, but in reality they are just using them as additional regressors.

I also discussed different papers and details on the tests used in those papers with Ian Wright.

## Assignment 3

For this assignment I went through the different tests on the felony rate on my own, and compared results and discussed interpretation of the results afterward with Ian Wright.

## Assignment 4

I again went through the entire assignment on my own, but had significant discussion about the process of munging the data and the meaning of the results with Ian Wright as well as Kristi Korsberg and others. Munging issues had to do with the effect (or lack thereof) of NaN values on the KS test, methods for selecting one of every 200 records, and putting Pearson's correlation test into words.
